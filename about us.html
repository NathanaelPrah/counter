        <h3 class="feature__heading">Why you need to partner Sage </h3>
        <p class="original">
          Sage provides a top-notch IT services and products to meet our clients's needs. Your business survival depends
          on your ability to focus on what's important. Cybercrime and data security are major challenges for businesses
          today. Cybercriminals are sophisticated users of technology. Defending yourself against such attacks need
          state of the art skills and tools. If you feel unable to respond effectively to this threat, this is where
          SAGE come in with the professional expertise and technology which are very difficult to achieve on a small
          scale.


          Keeping up to date with the latest tools and techniques is difficult. Attracting the best minds to combat
          these clever criminals is also a challenge. Our company finds it easier to recruit and retain talent and to
          continuously train and support them. Keeping up to date with technological developments can seem like chasing
          your tail. No sooner have you trained your people than the technology moves on and you have to do it again.
          Working with our company means you can take advantage of the opportunities for knowledge transfer.

        </p>
        <span class="dots">...</span>
        <p class="extra">
          
          By partnering Sage, you can scale your IT infrastructure up or down to meet your needs with far greater speed
          and less upfront hardware expense than if you tried to do it internally. Businesses carry important data such
          as employees's salary, income, and HR details. For this reason, data storage and management are very crucial
          for any kind of business and it is also a great example of why IT support is important. Hiring Sage, a team of
          highly skilled and knowledgeable professionals to manage and secure a company's valuable data goes
          hand-in-hand with the creation of an effective data management strategy.


          When branding is paired with information services and systems, it is not limited to enhancing existing
          marketing strategies alone or helping form a new advertising approach. Branding can be further augmented by
          Sage through maximizing the originality of a business's lineup of products and services. Developing apps and
          systems to drive higher customer engagement or boost satisfaction rates, as well as to gain an edge over
          competitors, effectively enhance a business's marketability, purpose and overall impact. Our company group has
          partnered with local and international organizations and other African countries governments to undertake
          projects to assist inefficiencies in system application modules.


          The company has also worked with Practical computers in providing cutting edge and state of the art
          information technology tools to institutions in Lesotho. This initiative provided the good people of Lesotho
          the opportunity to acquire computer-based knowledge and subsequently improved computer literacy in the area as
          the underprivileged children had access to state-of-the-art computers.
